Object Detection using Python and OpenCV Deep Learning:-

This project demonstrates a simple object detection pipeline using Python and OpenCV.
It captures video from a webcam and detects objects in real-time using pre-trained deep learning models.

Features:-
Real-time object detection via webcam.
Uses pre-trained models for accurate detection.
Displays bounding boxes and labels for detected objects.

Technologies Used:-
Python 3.11
OpenCV: For real-time video processing and object detection.
Pre-trained models: For detecting various objects

Setup and Installation
1.Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/Abdul-code-beep/Object-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Python.git
cd Object-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-Python
2.Install Dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Run the Object Detection Script: jupyter notebook Untitled.ipynb

Usage:-
Ensure your webcam is connected.
Run the notebook cells sequentially to start the object detection process.
The video feed will display detected objects with bounding boxes and labels.

Code Explanation:-
Video Capture: Captures live video feed from the webcam.
Object Detection: Uses a pre-trained model to detect objects in each video frame.
Bounding Boxes: Draws rectangles around detected objects and labels them.

Customization:-
Confidence Threshold: Adjust the confThreshold parameter in the detection code to change the sensitivity of object detection.
Font and Bounding Box Colors: Modify the color settings in the cv2.rectangle and cv2.putText functions to customize the appearance.

Demo:-
Add a GIF or image showcasing the object detection process in action.
